# Requirement 
   - You must have the same architecture between the SAP server and the Hobbit server 
     (Linux x64_64 for example). This Hobbit extension uses some SAP binaries who can 
      not been provided with this extension...
   - A generic user in SAP (service account) for remote check
   - A Hobbit server running ;)
   
######################
# Installation
  1/ Get binary from SAP : checkmySAP needs 2 binaries from SAP. 
     We are looking for 'lgtst' and 'rfcping' (should be in '/usr/sap/SID/FOOBAR/exe/')
     Find them on your SAP server and put it in '${BBHOME}/ext/checkmySAP/bin/'
     Make them executable (chmod) and owned by the Hobbit user (chown)
     
  2/ Those binaries needs 3 extra libraries also in '/usr/sap/SID/FOOBAR/exe/' :
        libicudata.so.30
        libicuuc.so.30
        libicui18n.so.30
     And put them is '${BBHOME}/ext/checkmySAP/lib/'
     
  3/ In your 'hobbitlaunch.cfg' : add those lines
        [SAP]
            ENVFILE /PATH/TO/HOBBIT/server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg
            NEEDS hobbitd
            CMD $BBHOME/ext/checkmySAP/checkmySAP.sh
            LOGFILE $BBSERVERLOGS/checkmySAP.log
            INTERVAL 5m
            
  4/ Edit the configuration file '${BBHOME}/ext/checkmySAP/checkmySAP.ini' according to 
     your needs. There are extra information on the header of 'checkmySAP.ini'.
     Example :
        ## Options for the rfcping command ##
        # Function,hostname,r3name,mshost,user,passwd,client,group
        rcfping,sapserver01,DEV,sapserver01,usersap,userpasswd,600,MYLOGONGROUP
        ## Options for the lgtst command ##
        # Function,hostname,name,mshost,msserv
        lgtst,sapserver01,DEV,sapserver01,sapmsDEV
     
  5/ Edit your '${BBHOME}/etc/bb-hosts' and add the keyword 'SAP' on host you want to monitor
     The host must have the same name in the 'checkmySAP.ini' & 'bb-hosts'
        0.0.0.0  sapserver01   # conn ssh SAP    NAME:"SAP Server 01" CLIENT:sapserver01.my.domain
     
  6/ Et voilà, the 'SAP' icon should appear in less then 5min.
